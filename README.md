# Vector

A web interface for the Materials Project API that makes it easy to search and explore materials science data.

## What it does

Vector connects to the Materials Project database and lets you:
- Search for materials by chemical formula, material ID, or chemical system
- View material properties like band gap, formation energy, and crystal structure
- Access thousands of materials from the Materials Project database
- Get data in a clean, easy-to-use interface

## Why we built it

The Materials Project has tons of useful data, but their API can be hard to use for people who aren't comfortable with code. Vector gives researchers and students a simple web interface to access this data without writing any code.
